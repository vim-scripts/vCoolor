vCoolor is a Vim plugin that allows using a GTK+ color selection dialog via Yad (http://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/) directly from the editor.

What this plugin do:
* Insert or modify a hex color even if there are many colors in 1 line.
* Modify a rgb color (Only one by line).

What this plugin doesn't do:
* Insert rgb (Can implement it if needed), rgba, hsv, hsva colors.
* Modify rgba, hsv (Working on it), hsva colors.

To get the last version or to have more informations check the github repo > https://github.com/KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim

Don't forget to rate it if you find it useful ( Or useless ;) ).

P.S: Works only on GNU/Linux.

usage
=====

In both NORMAL and INSERT modes, only 1 shortcut is needed: `<Alt-C>` (I find it very convenient :D), but he may be not working on terminal.

Use it:
* To insert a color anywhere.
* To modify the current hex or rgb color.
