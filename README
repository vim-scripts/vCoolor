vCoolor is a Vim plugin that allows using a color picker/selector directly from the editor.

What this plugin do:
* Insert hex, rgb, rgba (1 in opacity) or hsl color anywhere.
* Modify hex color even if there are many colors in 1 line.
* Modify a rgb color with 0-255 values or % (Only one by line).
* Modify a hsl color (Only one by line).
* Modify a rgba color but don't change opacity (Only one by line).

What this plugin doesn't do:
* Insert or modify hsla colors.

In GNU/Linux it uses a simple GTK+ dialog.
In windows it uses colorpicker-windows-commandline (https://github.com/jaxbot/colorpicker-windows-commandline) (The binary is included in the plugin).
In MAC OS it uses a ruby script (https://github.com/KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim/tree/master/osx/color-picker) to trigger the system color picker.

Don't forget to rate it if you find it useful ( Or useless ;) ).

usage
=====

In both NORMAL and INSERT modes, only 1 shortcut is needed: `<Alt-C>` (I find it very convenient :D), but he may be not working on terminal.

Use it:
* To insert a color anywhere.
* To modify the current hex, rgb, rgba or hsl color.

Using `<Alt-R>` you can insert a rgb color anywhere (NORMAL and INSERT modes).
Using `<Alt-V>` you can insert a hsl color anywhere (NORMAL and INSERT modes).
Using `<Alt-W>` you can insert a rgba color anywhere (NORMAL and INSERT modes).

Please refer to the documentation for a full overview of the plugin.
